                <h2>Reshma Saujani's Brave, Not Perfect: Fear Less, Fail More, and Live Bolder</h2>
                <p>In a book inspired by her popular TED talk, New York Times bestselling author Reshma Saujani empowers
                    Women and Girls to embrace imperfection and bravery.Imagine if you lived without the fear of not
                    being good enough. If you didn't care how your life looked on Instagram, or worry about what total
                    strangers thought of you. Imagine if you could let go of the guilt, and stop beating yourself up for
                    tiny mistakes. What if, in every decision you faced, you took the bolder path?Too many of us feel
                    crushed under the weight of our own expectations. We run ourselves ragged trying to please everyone,
                    all the time. We lose sleep ruminating about whether we may have offended someone, pass up
                    Opportunities that take us out of our comfort zones, and avoid rejection at all costs.There's a
                    reason we act this way, Reshma says. As girls, we were taught to play it safe. Well-meaning parents
                    and teachers praised us for being quiet and polite, urged us to be careful so we didn't get hurt,
                    and steered us to activities at which we could shine. The problem is that perfect Girls grow up to
                    be Women who are afraid to fail. It's Time to stop letting our fears drown out our dreams and narrow
                    our world, along with our chance at happiness.By choosing bravery over perfection, we can find the
                    power to claim our voice, to leave behind what makes us unhappy, and go for the things we genuinely,
                    passionately want. Perfection may set us on a path that feels safe, but bravery leads us to the one
                    we're authentically meant to follow.In Brave, Not Perfect, Reshma shares powerful insights and
                    practices to help us override our perfect girl training and make bravery a lifelong habit. By being
                    brave, not perfect, we can all become the authors of our biggest, boldest, and most joyful life.</p>
